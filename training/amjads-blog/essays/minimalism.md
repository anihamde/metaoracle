It's now fashionable to call yourself a "minimalist", but is that merely about not having things? I remember going to school everyday carrying nothing at all, no bag, no books, no pen, nothing -- I was a slacker. If I needed a
pen, say for a pop quiz, I had to borrow one quickly. In other words, I depended
on my classmates to provide the pen. Is this really minimalism? Yes, I didn't need the material possession of a pen, but I had to depend on others to provide the pen.

In Silicon Valley, where your company feeds you, washes your clothes, and supply your
social life, are you a minimalist for not having a kitchen, a washer, or friends
outside of work? Defined this way, a baby is the ultimate minimalist, after all
it has zero possessions and relies on the mother for everything.

I think self-sufficiency needs to be taken into account when evaluating
minimalism -- even if it's at the cost of having more material possessions. For
instance, buying a hair clipper and spending a bit of time learning how to
cut my own hair is definitely more minimal than relying on a barber that I have
to schedule with, pay to, and go to (that can get sick, go on vacation, or
move away).

A similar thing happens in software all the time -- is it more minimal:

- to use a service than it is implement your own?
- to take on a software package dependency than it is to write your own library?
- to have users always augment your app with some other app for a missing
  feature than it is to add it?

A Fake Minimalist will go with the former for every case.

In his ["Spec-ulation" talk](https://youtu.be/oyLBGkS5ICk?t=23m), Rich
Hickey brought this point home by defining software growth as (my emphasis):

- Accretion: to provide more functionality.
- __Relaxation: to require less (dependencies, inputs, etc).__
- Fixation: to fix bugs.
