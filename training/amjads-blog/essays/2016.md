I'm typically forward looking and barely take time to reflect (not to say
those two things are mutually exclusive). However, last year was a especially unique and
crazy, so in honor of that (and the new blog design) I decided to sit down,
reflect, and write something.

This will be roughly chronological going through the big events that took place last
year, and will conclude with some books, lectures, and ideas that had a big
impact on my thinking and worldview.

## Leaving Facebook

At the beginning of the year it seemed like I finally arrived at job
happiness. In 2015 I helped start the JS Infra team at Facebook. The motivation
for building this team came from my experience building the React Native Packager where I noticed that the
infrastructure that we're basing our development toolkit on was poorly
maintained, bug-ridden and in some cases poorly designed with no hope without a
full rewrite (or replacement).

So we assembled an amazing team of engineers to build out the basic building blocks that
would power Facebook's JavaScript development (and hopefully the JS community at large).

manager Tom Occhino_


Although the JS infra team was deeply technical and in some cases working on
problems a few layers removed from the developer experience, we always thought
it's best to start from the user experience and work our way backwards. For
instance, I remember talking to
someone from the Parse team who told me about a metric they used to make sure their
tools are easy to get started with: TTH, time till hello world. So when the time came to think about how people would get started with React
Native, it was obvious that the CLI needs to be robust enough to guide the user
all the way through to see something on the screen within 5 minutes of installation!

```bash
react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run
```

Although our team wasn't perfect, we had immediate impact starting with the
first half in our existence. We worked on and released Babel 6, which took Babel
from being merely a transpiler to being a platform and a compiler toolkit. We switched over
Facebook's entire JS infrastructure to use it. And not only used it for transpiling
it was now being used by teams throughout the company for things like i18n,
accessibility, optimization and so much more! We fixed Jest and it became a few order
of magnitudes faster. We continued improving on the React Native packager which
became a central piece of infrastructure at the company (both as a
development tool and as a build system).

Unfortunately, not everyone at the company believed that our team's existence is
justified. There was a big push to work on performance (which I
thought was justified since the website was very slow). So there was a lot of pressure on
us to dump everything that we're working on and focus a 100% on performance.

I didn't agree that
what we're doing and the performance goal weren't aligned. But in the
end I lost the office politics game and our team was all but
dismantled. Luckily, I had a great manager, and great support from many other
people at the company. So I was given a chance to find something I could
be as passionate about. But to be honest, my passion had already drifted
towards an old but growing side project of mine.

(A new and improved version of the team has now reassembled and are building
amazing things for the JS community -- like the Yarn package manager!)

## Starting Repl.it (the company)

In 2015 Haya Odeh and I planned to give an old side project of
ours a face-lift -- mostly just for fun. We knew that some people were using
[Repl.it](https://repl.it) but when we looked, we where surprised to see that there are 10s of
thousands of people using it a month. We started researching, visiting our
users, and doing surveys. We found that our biggest impact was on physical
classrooms across the country and the world. (Which was not that big of a
surprise).

[Repl.it](https://repl.it) was
always at least partly about education. Back in school, I was displeased with the fact that every
class I went to
had to spend hours installing software. And I watched the instructor struggle to
get everyone's compilers and editors setup (with matching versions). I started
dreaming up a site where you open a new tab and start coding. And in 2011 that's
what we built and not only did it help with that, we open-sourced the underlying
execution engine (built with emscripten) which went to on power many
learn-to-code websites (most famously, Codecademy, which I joined as the #1
employee).

One thing lead to another, and my brother Faris joined us in working on the
project and we ended up not only redesigning the website, but we added user
accounts, built a [cloud-based code execution engine](https://repl.it/api) and
many smaller features. We also started planning a totally new product on top of
our core offering -- a classroom product that automates many of the tedious tasks
we noticed a teacher has to do to manage their classroom. Things like submitting
homework, giving feedback on homework, and tracking student progress.

We incorporated in May, 2016 with the mission to make programming more
accessible. We're building powerful yet simple coding interfaces for programmers
and students. And we're building a platform for teachers that want to bring
programming to their classroom or reach a wider audience online.

### Repl.it classroom

We rushed to build our first major product as a company. After tons of
research and a tight feedback loop with a handful of teachers it was ready for
the release just before the fall school season started. We launched in August and much
to our surprise that put us on an exponential growth curve. Professors at universities
like CMU signed up and used us to teach "Math Background for Machine
Learning", followed by MIT, Cornell and many others. Bootcamps like Hack Reactor and App Academy used us for introductory
courses. And high-schools across the US, UK, Japan, and elsewhere in the world
started signing up.

### Partners

We're so lucky to be in this part of the world -- Silicon Valley is a place where immigrants can
come in and build companies. We're double lucky to have found the support and
mentorship of amazing people. Repl.it is now backed by Bloomberg Beta and Reach
capital and I could've never imagined that the founder/investor relationship
could be this good. We're still starting out and the journey is only 0.0001%
complete (Facebook likes to say it's 1% complete), but whatever modest success
we achieved we couldn't have done it without the support and mentorship of Roy
Bahat, Wayee Chu, Christina Cacioppo, Chris Mather, and Ly Nguyen.

### Repl.it in 2017

We spent the last quarter of 2016 focused on the core REPL product -- adding
more power yet maintaining the simplicity. We added support for [third-party
libraries](https://repl.it/site/blog/package-search), implemented a
[debugger](https://repl.it/site/blog/python-debugger), and live file updates.
You can see more on our [blog](https://repl.it/blog).

We also grew the team and hired our first employee. This month, we'll be moving
to our first private office and we're hoping to add more engineers to the team
soon. We have a lot of interesting technical challenges, and we'd like to think
we're working on an important mission, if that's interesting to you then
consider joining us :)

This year we're going to continue being heads-down focused on product and
technology. We have a lot of interesting features in the pipeline. But most
importantly we want to find ways to have our teachers, students, and
engineers collaborate with each other and build an awesome community.

## Thoughts, books, etc

#### Coming to terms with Physicalism

You don't notice how much outdated belief you have in your head until you
sit down and examine them. In a recent talk, [Alan Kay
describes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhOHn9TClXY&feature=youtu.be&t=1h1m6s)
how every 3-5 years he sits down and writes down all his beliefs in an effort to
update them.

This year I did this for my worldview and my philosophy on the
nature of the universe. Physicalism is the thesis that everything is
physical. That means -- among many other things -- that your mind/soul is a product of the physical processes
in your body, and it obeys the laws of physics just like an apple falling from a
tree. The implications here are big and many. It also could be scary, but luckily I was aided
by a few books that I recommend to anyone who wants to come to terms with this.

#### [Rationality: From AI to Zombies](https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/)

To build an AI you need to understand and describe how the human mind works (and
how it often doesn't). This book helped me in a few ways:

* I now understand pervasiveness of cognitive biases and fallacies. In the words
of Richard Feynman: "You are the easiest person to fool".
* Using a mix fables and science the author gently guides you from the default dualist
belief (mind is separate from the body/world) to a purely physical world.
* Presents different ways to think about some of the seeming absurdities of Physicalism (for
example, are we all just cogs in the unwinding clock that is the universe?).

The book has all sorts of tips and tricks to help you face up to the truth. One
of my favorites is the ["Litany of
Gendlin"](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin):

>What is true is already so.<br/>
>Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.<br/>
>Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.<br/>
>And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.<br/>
>Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.<br/>
>People can stand what is true,<br/>
>for they are already enduring it.

#### [The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359)

This book layed out the basis for a hopeful and optimistic Physicalist
worldview. It gives people (or universal explainers in general, as
the book calls them) a more privilege place in the universe. Yes, we are
"chemical scum" that evolved via Darwinian selection but our reach can be
infinite. And our journey has just begun towards the infinite creation of knowledge.

#### Personal Identity

The concept of "self" seems to be a hack. Evolution gave us this abstraction
because it seems to simplify a lot of things -- most importantly,
self-preservation (so we can take care of ourselves until we procreate). This
idea started forming in my head in 2015 after reading [Marvin
Minsky's Society of
Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Society-Mind-Marvin-Minsky/dp/0671657135), which
plausibly breaks down the mind into modules and presents it as if it's a big
piece of software.

Consider how split brain patients seem to have two sides of their brains
behave somewhat autonomously (as if it's a different person). In this
[video](https://youtu.be/aCv4K5aStdU?t=1m35s) the patient's right hemisphere is
shown a word (via his left eye) but he couldn't say what it was. However, when
he closed his eyes and started drawing he was able to draw a pan (which is the
word that he saw).

This is just scratching the surface, earlier this year I started reading [Reasons
and Persons](https://www.amazon.com/Reasons-Persons-Derek-Parfit/dp/019824908X)
by the late Derek Parfit (died a few days ago). It includes all sorts of
thought experiments that all but destroys the concept of self. I couldn't
finish the book because it was too hard and jargony. However, luckily, I found
a course on YouTube titled [Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2J7wSuFRl8&list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0) that draws heavily from Parfit's work on
personal identity. And this completely shattered how I thought about my self and
my place in the world.

I'm now more accepting of the fact that I and everyone I know and love
will die in the not very distant future. I feel more connected to other
people. And finally understand what it means to have an impact in the
world (improve lives and reduce suffering).


(For a quick primer on the subject I recommend Wait But Why's ["What Makes You
You?"](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html) essay).

Thanks for reading.
