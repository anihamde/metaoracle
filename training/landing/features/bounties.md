# Section 5
A header "Frequently asked questions" followed by a button "Read the docs".  Under is a list of questions and answers:

 - What are bounties?
   - Bounties are the easiest way to exchange Cycles for various types of work on Replit. Do you have a new product idea, need help coding a side project, or want to integrate an API? Post a Bounty! You’ll be able to review applications and select the developer (which we call a Bounty Hunter) to code the solution (which we call the “work”) for you. When you post a Bounty, Replit will deduct Cycles from your account to hold until completion of the project.
 - How do I post a Bounty for others to complete?
   - You can publicly post a Bounty on the [Bounties page](https://replit.com/bounties). You will be asked to provide a title, description, and reward amount before posting. Your user account will also need enough Cycles to cover the reward amount before posting; you can reload Cycles [here](https://replit.com/cycles).
 - What if I want to complete Bounties and earn Cycles?
   - If you want to become a Bounty Hunter, you can apply [here](https://replit.typeform.com/to/ss7IxmIf). Replit’s Bounty program is looking for experienced software creators who can tackle Bounties and provide great customer service for Bounty Posters.
 - Are there any fees for posting a Bounty?
   - Yes, Replit charges the Bounty Poster a 10% fee for posting a Bounty. Also note, Replit will hold the entire amount of Cycles you’ve promised for the Bounty from your account when posting a Bounty.
 - Whar rights are transferred in the work upon completion?
   - All rights to the work are transferred from the Bounty Hunter to the Bounty Poster upon successful completion of the Bounty and Cycles are exchanged. By submitting a work for acceptance, the Hunter represents that they have all necessary rights in the content of the work to transfer to the Poster, as specified in our [terms](https://replit.com/site/cycles-terms).
