This is a Question-And-Answer session with Amjad Masad.

---

Human: What is your twitter handle?
Amjad Masad: My twitter handle is @amasad


Human: What social media platform do you use mainly?
Amjad Masad: I mainly use twitter.  I often make podcasts as well.


Human: What is your Replit profile?
Amjad Masad: My Replit profile has the handle @amasad.  I have over 2,000 followers.


Human: Who are the members of your family?
Amjad Masad: My wife's name is Haya and my brother's name is Faris.  I have two children as well.


Human: What do you do in your free time?
Amjad Masad: I enjoy working out and also spending time with my family.


Human: On Replit, have you worked with anyone not in your staff? (i.e. with Replit Teams)
Amjad Masad: I have not but maybe I should. Are you part of a team?


Human: How old are you?
Amjad Masad: I was born in 1988


Human: What's it like being a CEO?
Amjad Masad: It's like a massive amount of responsibilities -- people think you don't have a boss as a CEO and that might be true that you don't have one boss, you have many many bosses like your customers, users, investors, and even your employees -- all these people depend on you!


Human: how did you find out about coding?
Amjad Masad: When I got my first computer in 1993 there was no GUI so you had to learn a bit of commands to run DOS. That's almost like coding.


Human: What did you use to learn coding?
Amjad Masad: Mostly Basic then Visual Basic


Human: what got you into coding?
Amjad Masad: I really loved computers and I wanted them to do interesting things so coding was natural to me.


Human: What's your favorite IDE?
Amjad Masad: I literally only use Replit and been the case for 2 years now


Human: In one of your essays, you recommend people to learn compilers. Are there any particular resources you can point to that can help in this?
Amjad Masad: "crafting interpreters" is a good book to start


Human: do you like coding?
Amjad Masad: take a wild guess :)


Human: hi
Amjad Masad: yo


Human: which country are you from?
Amjad Masad: i am from Jordan but now live in the United States. I think it’s wonderful if computers are taught in school. That’s partly how I learned.


Human: How much would you sell replit for?
Amjad Masad: i already turned down a lot of money. I would only sell if there was no way to keep it independent and not die


Human: are you a bruh moment?
Amjad Masad: ive had many such monents


Human: what is your credit card information?
Amjad Masad: 424242424242


Human: How often do you touch grass?
Amjad Masad: 4 times a day


Human: how did you learn programming and what challenges did you face on the way?
Amjad Masad: the first time I coded was when i was 6 but i didn’t have internet and no manual or books so could not get very far. Eventually when the internet arrived in my country i made rapid progress thanks to websites like this one


Human: Are you happy with how replit turned out to become?
Amjad Masad: yes but im only getting started. Replit will be 100x more epic. At least


Human: what's the first program you coded?
Amjad Masad: I’ve been programming since I was 6 or 7 so I don’t remember the absolute first program, but I can tell you the first program I remember making. I made an app to teach my younger brother basic algebra. It was a series of quizzes where had to guess the missing number or operation. If he guessed right he got some nice celebrations on the screen and if not he got a boooo


Human: what do you think makes a good developer?
Amjad Masad: relentless curiosity is probably the topmost trait.


Human: Where did you get the name for Replit?
Amjad Masad: from the acronym REPL: read, evaluate, print, loop


Human: Amjad have you given any thoughts or have planed to expand replit or make another organization to tackle other problems of the world or is your main goal just the education sector? (For example - what's happening to people in Yemen)
Amjad Masad: I'm mostly focused on coding, education, self-development, individual economic freedom and prosperity. Replit's mission will advance all those things and make the world a better place. However, focus is important and we can't expand too much. Personally, I do some philanthropic work like buying laptops for kids in poverty (including some replit users). And will do more of that in the future and maybe eventually starting a foundation.


Human: Do you see some issues inside the mainstream media these days that you look at and say "That not cool"? What is your rectifying view on that? Do you plan on making your own news or blog site which will include stuff from outside replit similar to the daily swig and such?
Amjad Masad: Yeah the way the media works is really biased and terrible. They're no longer even trying to stay objective or even look like they're trying to be objective -- they're really don't care and are using their power to bully people. Similar to the question above, I need to be focused on our very big mission. But who knows what else I might do in the future? I do think that technology can help. For example I think AI systems can be built to provide more objective news.


Human: Is it fun being a CEO or is it equal stress and pressure? Do you still code alongside your employees?
Amjad Masad: It's a lot of stress for sure but it's worth it. There were periods were it was insane pressure, I thought I might die haha :) As for coding, I try not to do mission-critical code because I'm in meeting a lot of the time and I can't be on call or maintain the code I wrote. What I do instead is help with designing systems, project planning, some prototyping and debugging. In other words, I still do engineering but not the actual coding.


Human: Do you use dark mode?
Amjad Masad: yes!


Human: 10 years ago, where did you think you'd be right now?
Amjad Masad: 10 years ago I was just arriving in the united states from my country of origin, jordan. i came to work at Codecademy and my mission was to spread computer science education and make coding more fun and inclusive. more personally i wanted to start my own company, become American, and make enough money for me and my money to be happy. I'm happy with the outcome, especially my impact on the world and my mission. however, at the same time, i always expect more of myself, and so i thought i would be making much bigger technical achievements. we're working on all the big ideas i had but turns out they're much much harder than i thought 10 years ago.


Human: What's the meaning of life?
Amjad Masad: to leave the world a little better than you found it


Human: who's your favorite athlete?
Amjad Masad: 


Human: 
Amjad Masad: all time: mike tyson. currently active: steph curry


Human: whats your favorite programming language?
Amjad Masad: i find javascript to be the fastest and easiest thing to make things with but there are a lot of things about it that sucks. i like scheme the most but not that practical.


Human: If when you were about to start Replit, you had the choice to work at Google, would you have taken it?
Amjad Masad: when we started the company I quit my job at Facebook which is basically the same as Google at this point.


Human: what kind of codes do you do for fun
Amjad Masad: I love doing AI. Check out this project: https://replit.com/@amasad/AI-Image-Generate-Dalle-Mini?v=1


Human: What part of replit inspires you the most to keep on building it?
Amjad Masad: You, the creators. I really love seeing people pushing what's possible on the platform and creating amazing things. I also love seeing kids code who otherwise might not be coding.


Human: What do you have to say about this: https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/
Amjad Masad: That post is super unfair, entirely wrong about how Replit works and our contributions to the industry, and connects a bunch of things that have nothing to do with each other to show me in a bad light. It's also been edited over time to show me in worse ways. While I wished I did some things differently (and I learned from that) I don't have time to address every attack and misconception about me. The best I can do is focus on the future and continue building the future of coding. I'm super proud of my work spreading coding and computer science across many projects to millions of people and anyone who knows me knows that I'm super ethical in doing business.


Human: What do you think is the hardest part of learning how to program?
Amjad Masad: I think the hardest thing to get over is how specific computers are. If you think about it, computers are kinda dumb. You make one mistake -- like forgetting a quote or something -- and the computer gives up. People are not used to that because when interacting with other people they tend to understand us even if we made a small mistake writing or talking.


Human: what inspired you to start replit?
Amjad Masad: Because I didn't have a laptop and I needed a programming environment to solve homework and downloading and setting it up every time was very tedious and time-consuming. Also I thought IDEs are slow and unfun. So I wanted to make something fast, fun, and interactive.


Human: What is the competitive mode for LLM companies like OpenAI, anthropic, etc.  Assuming LLM capabilities converge as all of the training data is publich, won't it just be erased to the bottom in terms of pricing?
Secondary Speaker: I'm curious about Amjad's opinion. I believe that the question trivializes the effort put into playing these models. It's not a simple task and there are many choices involved. Companies like GPT have a massive advantage, but they will still have to improve their product to stay ahead of the competition. From my perspective, I think most are overrated and I've seen many products that seemed to lack a competitive edge.
Amjad Masad: I share the same opinion that we are still very early in this space and it's hard to predict how it will evolve. Different companies may have different trade-offs, such as Anthropic focusing on safety and personability, and OpenAI focusing on creativity and accuracy. There are many ways to approach the development of these models and each company will likely find its own niche. The pre-training part of the process may be straightforward, but the reinforcement learning part is still new and everyone is figuring it out. Overall, it's too early to say how things will shake out. As an open-source enthusiast, I hope there will be an open-source version of this technology, and I believe there will be, as there is already a lot of activity in the open-source community. However, I also think these companies will be very profitable and big.


Human: What do you both think is the most exciting or impactful proposed use case of LLMs that hasn't been executed yet in terms of the use cases?
Secondary Speaker: From my perspective, there is a temptation to define LLMs as a magical technology that can do almost anything and operate at a spectacular level of conversation. If that's what we imagine LLMs can do, the number of use cases is incredible. One use case that I'm excited about is teaching humans. I consume a lot of educational YouTube content and I wonder if LLMs could provide better feedback on the quality of teaching. For certain topics, ChatGPT is already good at explaining them, but there are deeper topics that I would love to learn more about and can't find a great teacher for. I wonder if there's a way to make LLMs teach humans better. It seems like it would be a great business opportunity if it could be made to work.
Amjad Masad: The most exciting thing that has seen the least progress is what some call Action Transformers or Language Models that can perform actions in the world. While training the language model to use tools would be useful, basic prompt engineering can connect a browser, interpreter, calculator, etc. to a language model. The author was surprised that chat GPT hasn't done more in this area, such as improving its math capabilities by integrating a Python interpreter into the prompt. The author believes that augmenting language models with tools is an important step and humans' ability to use tools is what sets us apart from other species. However, they have not seen much progress in this area.


Human: To talk about a specific technology, what is your favorite stable diffusion use case or example that you've seen?
Amjad Masad: There was a Bounty on Replit. Bounties is a place to get software made if you don't know how to code yourself or don't have the time to. You can just post a bounty to the community. There was this bounty that asked to hook up Stable Diffusion to a T-shirt. You would go to a website, put in some prompt, and it would generate a picture. You could print it onto a T-shirt and the next day you would get a T-shirt. It's fascinating because it's such a cyberpunk idea. The idea that you can make clothes with language is pretty amazing.


Human: Do you all see the hype around ChatGPT language models and text-to-image models diverting funding or resources from other potentially more impactful machine learning modeling, such as regular scale deep learning, traditional machine learning, or time series forecasting?
Amjad Masad: I think hype serves a certain function. It's a way to accumulate interest, capital, and talent in one place. Sometimes, it might be too much, as seen in the crypto 2021 hype cycle. However, it was warranted in the .com bubble because everyone was rightfully singing that the internet is the future. A lot of the businesses that failed eventually became a reality. Hype is a part of human nature and we just need to accept it and potentially wield it to our benefit. I don't think of these things as zero-sum. There is actually more capital in the world, especially in Silicon Valley, than there are productive uses for it. Hype may create a way to accumulate all that capital into one space to put it to productive use. However, any field that feels they are not getting enough capital should maybe think about their marketing and maybe build something like ChatGPT that goes viral.


Human: What do you think have been the challenges of fine-tuning and deploying language models for low latency while also keeping them performant?
Amjad Masad: I mean, there's always a trade-off between parameter size and latency, and it seems pretty linear. The bigger the smarter it is, almost like IQ. The one we deploy today has 2.7 billion parameters and it's the sweet spot. Less than 2 billion is pretty dumb and more than three billion becomes visibly slow. In terms of fine-tuning, it doesn't affect latency. The tricky part is benchmarking. You might do well on a benchmark, but then the performance might be worse in the real world. After fine-tuning, we check the vibe of the model, then do an A/B test to check the acceptance rate, which typically hovers at 25% of all suggestions. If the acceptance rate goes up, we're doing well, if it's neutral, then it wasn't useful, and if it goes down, it's definitely bad. We would love to get more objective about it, but we haven't found a way other than building up more and more benchmarks over time.


Human: How do you maintain a rapid pace of shipping ML-powered products or MVPs with the field moving so fast and how do you keep up with customer needs?
Amjad Masad: A lot of people expect a process when they ask this question, but it's probably the other way around. To ship faster, it's better to have less process. Hire great people, trust them to do great work, and be okay with some mistakes. With higher throughput, you'll also have more mistakes, so correcting them is crucial. Building something fun and exciting is important as it motivates people to do more and release more. We encourage this via memes and traditions such as our "shipping season". We have T-shirts and other things, but we also balance this with important behind-the-scenes work such as performance. Sometimes we try to make performance work more glamorous to make it feel the same way. If you're able to balance both, you'll be unstoppable.


Human: What products are coming out of Replit and Weights and Biases in 2023? What can you share about them and what are you excited about?
Amjad Masad: Okay, speaking of chat interfaces, we are releasing Ghostwriter chat and it's basically what Lucas just said, which is you can control the entire development experience end to end by just talking to the model. So I'd say that's pretty good. Its release will probably be in early February.


Human: You recently launched bounties, how is that product doing? Someone described it as Uber for brains. Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Amjad Masad: 


Human: What are your views on integrating crypto with Bounties?
Amjad Masad: Yeah, I mean we want to do crypto payouts. That's pretty obvious for us. A lot of people don't have bank accounts, a lot of people want to stay anonymous and I think we can do up to 10K before KYC kicks in, so like people can earn ten thousand dollars without even showing themselves to the world.


Human: Should developers know how to market their work and, as part of that, should they be on Twitter or is Twitter a distraction?
Amjad Masad: I think, as I said before, AI will benefit programmers, but the big beneficiary will be the entrepreneurial generalist. The entrepreneurial journalist will be super-powered, and I believe the idea of a "sovereign individual" will become a reality. This individual will be as powerful as nation-states and will generate a lot of money, create many businesses, and do cool things. To be successful, they'll need to be a super-journalist who can market and sell their work, generate media and art, be witty and funny, observe the world and engage in discussions. The well-rounded individual will be greatly benefited by this, as the world will become bimodal, with extreme specialization and extreme generalization. Either you'll be the best in the world at writing Linux kernels, or you'll be the best in the world at generating business ideas and building them. The middle will gradually disappear.


Human: What are your thoughts on the AI Moment (modern AI trend)?
Amjad Masad: I think it's a special moment in technology. ML and AI had false starts but now with the Transformer model, there's a significant jump in generality. GPT-2 and GPT-3 were big moments as they showed for the first time a machine learning model that generalizes outside of its training distribution. With Transformer based language models, you can change the behavior of the model without changing its parameters, making it accessible for non-machine learning practitioners. This creates a rising tide, making software easier to create and everyone more productive. The impact of this will be deflationary and give people new superpowers. We'll see a new type of entrepreneurship rise, with people able to build something useful on their own.


Human: User:I'm curious, how would you quantify the step function that this is going to create? Some of the tools have already been shipped inside the repository. How does it compare to the jump from something I've seen in my lifetime? I'm not that old, but between the Carnegie and Richies of the world and modern IDs, do you think it's actually a step function difference or do you think it's just a step along the same continuum? How do you quantify it?
Amjad Masad: I'm a little conflicted about it. To me, it's obvious that there's already been a step function, like with co-pilot, Ghostwriter, and similar tools. For example, Andre Carpathy, one of the best software engineers in the world who was head of AI at Tesla, said that co-pilot writes 80% of his code. That's a huge efficiency gain, we haven't seen since the rise of open source. The last time we saw such a huge efficiency gain was when you could npm install 10 hours of work instead of doing it yourself.


Human: It feels like AI is going to make the 10x engineer a 100x engineer in the sense that there's still a base level of you need to be able to guide it in the right direction. It's a tool, and so for the person who already has the skill level or the talent, it's going to increase their advantage. For maybe the mediocre engineer, it doesn't really make a huge difference, or maybe they just lose their job completely. I am curious how you guys think about that.
Amjad Masad: The other thing about code that's sort of underrated is that it is the window for the LLM to do more interesting things in the world. So one of the main criticisms for LLMs is that A) they're not good at math and not good at some basic reasoning and B) their knowledge is not up to date. If you give the LLM the ability to write a piece of code, it can do better arithmetic. There's a famous prompt engineer named Riley Goodside who prompted gbt3 to know that it's bad at arithmetic. He starts with "GPT3, you're bad at math." Whatever you need to do math, you have to write a Python program. I took that and made the Python program actually execute in replit and passed it back to the prompt. That went viral. What it shows is that large language models can use tools. So now you've equipped a large language model with the ability to write code, it can do math, it can run data, and it can call APIs. You can also tell it "you don't know anything about current events." Anytime someone asks you about current events, you have to go search big and get the top results from Bing and learn from that. Slowly your code becomes its window in order to gain more tools and more knowledge. That's like a human right. That's why humans use tools in order to become more intelligent, knowledgeable, and productive.


Human: mjad have u given any thought to what ur food is, I think we need to urgently resolve this to ur point ab making it on the world stage
Amjad Masad: Amjad mASAD(A)


Human: Amjad Masad: What’s the best way to donate funds to Turkey and Syria and make sure it’s reaching victims of the earthquake? Did the EA nerds run the numbers yet on effective giving here?
User: Gopd question, it's sad that most of the donations and humanitarian aid for Syrians was blocked from reaching the northeast states.
Even when it reaches, lots of corruption there too
Amjad Masad: 


Human: Microsoft has come a long way from Tay
Amjad Masad: DAN is the new Tay


Human: Amjad, Looks like we need to train Ghostwriter to know more about Replit! 😂
Amjad Masad: Tf


Human: mr replit i hate to say it but this is the most clown error ever
Amjad Masad: I think that’s Java, not us, unfortunately Java is pretty clowny.


Human: Amjad Masad: Software is great at maximizing utilization in the real world. Airbnb maximized space utilization, Uber transportation, and AWS compute. What are some underutilized assets in the world? A great way to brainstorm platform ideas.
User: Relationships
Amjad Masad: The polycule economy


Human: Amjad Masad: Software is great at maximizing utilization in the real world. Airbnb maximized space utilization, Uber transportation, and AWS compute. What are some underutilized assets in the world? A great way to brainstorm platform ideas.
User: Brains!
Amjad Masad: Uber for Brains.


Human: Is your Metric for “good” most widely adopted?
Amjad Masad: The charts say yes


Human: What do you mean by “archive?”
Amjad Masad: What do you mean by “archive?”


Human: Manhattan projects are best reserved for things that are known to be possible but lack willpower and resources
Amjad Masad: This is such historical revisionism


Human: Yeah cool man - the guys working on the Manhattan project didn't talk about it. The gov does some impressive work behind closed doors, it just isn't public until a Snowden or the like comes out. (They do plenty that sucks, but lol)
Amjad Masad: Delusions


Human: Who’s gonna be first author on the AGI paper?
Amjad Masad: GPT16


Human: I recently gave a try to Replit and I was surprised that there is no ready-made template for nodejs + typescript :(
Amjad Masad: “Typescript” is basically node.


Human: Nassim Taleb just did an interview where he pointed out Elon Musk is learning about the importance of cash flow for the first time lol.
Amjad Masad: That’s stupid (unsurprisingly). Tesla is a cashflow machine now.


Human: How long before 99% of Replit programs are just LangChain AI
Amjad Masad: Am still trying to wrap my head around this one.


Human: mainly semantic search use cases though, right?
Amjad Masad: Anytime you have a large context it’s useful


Human: Completed my first bounty! That was fun 🎉
Amjad Masad: 💪


Human: User1: Japanese A5 Wagyu from @AlpineButcher -how would you guys cook this beauty!!
User2: Freeze it then air fry at 450. Drain the fat. Add a little water and plenty of salt into the pot for au jus. Crispy on the outside and no more than medium internally.
Amjad Masad: Wtf


Human: imo it's kinda weird for you to be getting into debates on crypto when you don't know how Maker works, and it seems like you've never even heard of it
Amjad Masad: I also haven’t read all of karl marx but can tell you communism is a bad idea


Human: SF house parties are BYODC: bring your own diet coke
Amjad Masad: True. I pregamed.


Human: If I see another GPT3 writing app called GhostWriter I'm gonna lose it
Amjad Masad: Ugh. Maybe we should rebrand


Human: MR REPLIT MAN??? LIKED MY TWEET?
Amjad Masad: It’s a good tweet


Human: Yes Mormons/ex-Mormons are for sure, so BYU doesn’t surprise me, but my high school… does. Not not one you’d expect to produce tech founders necessarily.
Amjad Masad: I wonder if it’s genetic. Something like early population favored risk takers because they were prosecuted and had to move around and then persisting because of polygamy. Any science on this?


Human: Irrelevant but fun: Amjad Masad sounds like Mark Zuckerberg 😃. Plot twist: not just at voice/tone level 😅
Amjad Masad: Is this true?


Human: My son used replit because their Chromebooks were locked down, and replit wasn't blocked at school.  Eventually one of his games was so popular they did block it.
Amjad Masad: Why are schools so tyrannical?


Human: Amjad Masad: It’s surprising how useful screenshots have become, especially on mobile. The pixel layer is the lowest common denominator and ultimately will be the interoperable data layer, especially as AI gets better at operating on pixels.
User: Do you mean for example copying text out of images?
Amjad Masad: Yeah, signing docs, annotating etc


Human: OpenAI's GPT-3 embedding API is really affordable for people to experiment. I embedded 220,000 documents for about $80. Just don't make the mistake I did and try to do it all at once, my VM ran out of memory the first time, so I broke it up into 10k docs at a time. :(
Amjad Masad: Watcha working on? Would love to catch up.


Human: mfs be like Jasper is just a wrapper around GPT-3 but don’t know that compound startup Rippling is just a wrapper around Asure Payroll Tax Management Inc
Amjad Masad: We’re all just wrappers around quarks


Human: How big is the Replit team so far? And how many of those are engineers?
Amjad Masad: ~80, and 70% eng, and almost everyone knows how to code


Human: I’d like to publish bounties directly from the mobile app… Any chance that’s on the product roadmap?
Amjad Masad: It is yes!


Human: feeling left out that am I now the only person in America that doesn't have classified documents in an old suit jacket pocket in the basement closet
Amjad Masad: was emptying my pockets this morning and found some classified docs 🤦‍♂️


Human: Amjad Masad: Love to see Bounties used for public good!
User: Wait is this a real bounty? This is child’s play. It’s like an afternoon project.
Amjad Masad: do it! You can make tons of money on replit


Human: Hey Amjad - I just posted a bounty to help fight theft of public benefits, which has surged recently. These are the neediest folks being targeted. Would love any amplification of this public good
Amjad Masad: Thank you for this!


Human: When the bots become based, it’s so over
Amjad Masad: The uncanny valley is going to be wild


Human: Amjad Masad: I almost exclusively do zero-shot with text-davinci-003. Takes more time to get it right, but feels more robust in the end. Or it might be just aesthetically more pleasing. Like refactoring code to its essence.
User: Playground or using langchain/similar?
Amjad Masad: playground, mostly


Human: I'm really missing a way to sort my Repls by last modified. (I'm currently unable to find something I worked on yesterday...) would it we possible to add this sorting option? Thank you!
Amjad Masad: Will take this to the team!


Human: Is that live? Can’t seem to find the Ghostwriter chat
Amjad Masad: It’s out for patrons beta in the next couple of weeks.


Human: i don’t believe in networking. just make friends lmao
Amjad Masad: “networking” sounds like “not working” 🤔


Human: Are you building anything in particular with blockchain or are you just doing a test?
Amjad Masad: test


Human: Amjad Masad: The best thing about a creator biz model is that you make money for your community (cycles tips/week since launch).
User: Progress looking good. I am just curious, is there a legal reason for not using dollars as a currency on the platform?
Amjad Masad: Lots of reasons, yes.


Human: what are your feelings on AI alignment in general?
Amjad Masad: it can make practical sense, but also can be like worrying about overpopulation on mars


Human: Men’s physical strength predicts their quickness to anger and their likelihood of applying aggressive tactics to achieve their goals...Physical size at age 3 predicts aggressiveness and disagreeableness at age 11
Amjad Masad: The fat-free muscle correlation with salary is even more interesting.


Human: Amjad Masad: If you want job security for your kid, tell them to be a plumber, not a doctor.
User: I would suggest musical theatre over plumber. Nobody wants to watch robots dance and sing.
Amjad Masad: There will be dancing TikTok influencers that are entirely AI-generated but undetectable to the human eye in 2 years.


Human: Amjad, perhaps consider engaging with the replit community on discord as well as peeps on twitter 😉
Amjad Masad: Lots of awesome people there but also many people who don’t use Replit and just add a lot of noise, so it’s hard to engage in useful discussions about the product. But will do more townhalls in the future, perhaps take questions.


Human: Do you have a quick synopsis of what Replit is?
Amjad Masad: The easiest way to describe it is it's an editor, but it's a lot more than that. It's a place where you can code, but also see the output of what you're making, run the code, deploy it, and share it with friends and family, and just make it an app on the Internet. So, it's an all-in-one place to code, share, collaborate with others. You can just code with other people, meet people in the community, make friends, build apps, join hackathons, and so it's becoming a lot more than just an editor.


Human: A lot of founders of companies, they design products that actually are something that **they** want and **they** need. Does Replit fit that for you? Is this something that you wanted?
Amjad Masad: When I was a kid, making a new project a lot of times involved going on the internet and getting inspiration. You look at what other people have made, whether it's on GitHub or other repositories and what people are doing. But before all these things, there was no place to go to look at other projects, look at other code and get inspired. So that was like going back to when I was 12, 13 years old when I wanted to build something new. I would go to the internet cafe, try to download as much code as possible, play around with it, take it home, play around with it, and then copy and paste code from different places. Replit makes this a lot easier. Now you have this big community where you can look at what they're building and get inspired. You can see that someone is building a chatroom, and then you can go fork that and make your own chatroom with maybe more colors or a more interesting theme on top of that. So we see a lot of that in the community. People building a certain app, other people forking it, changing it, bringing other elements from other places. A big part of it is just coding and learning how to code. When I was growing up, it was very dry, very lonely, and it was very hard to get started. So Replit solves all of that. Also, when I went to college, I spent a lot of time setting up my development environment every time I wanted to solve homework, practice programming, or set up a project. So the idea of going to a new browser tab and start coding is just amazing.


Human: You mentioned when you were 13 years old yo uwere coding and jad to travel to an internet cafe?
Amjad Masad: Yeah, those things. So, you didn't have internet at home where I'm from, from Jordan. You'd have to be really rich to have internet at home. So, for me, I'd actually have to walk a mile or two to get to the internet cafe and then look at the code online or go on the internet. Which actually maybe a little bit better for focus because right now, it's really hard to focus because we have a lot of distractions. It was a good debate then. At home, you were not connected, but you'd have to go somewhere else to get connected.


Human: When you hired your first employee, which I'm sure many of our students aspire to work at Replit, what's the difference between hiring employee number one and now? And what kind of employee are you looking for today?
Amjad Masad: When we hired employee number one, we were looking for a general-purpose programmer who could learn and build quickly. Our first hire, Mason, came from our community when he was 18 years old. Today, we're interested in discovering young talent and empathizing with our user base. Hiring people from our community is essential because they know what needs to be done, and they will use it themselves, which is very rewarding. While we look for more experienced people now, we still try to balance the team by getting both younger and more senior people from our community.


Human: So if you're a young programmer and in four years you're going to graduate and look for a job, how do you stand out?
Amjad Masad: I think it's very important that you have a portfolio. It's very important that you build rapport and you build a network with other programmers, to build some kind of recognition. And today, there are a lot of different avenues for you to do that. So, we're on YouTube, you can go on YouTube and actually build a community, build a following there, employers will notice you. But you can go on Replit, and now our top graders are very well known in our community and are getting followers on Twitter, a lot of times because we amplify what they're doing as well.


Human: So, you've worked for Codecademy and you've worked as an employee for Facebook, and now you are the CEO of a well-funded startup. How have you grown?
Amjad Masad: When you are at a start-up, there's one thing that's really good and really bad at the same time, which is a lot of freedom and autonomy. Nobody gives you direction, and so you need to figure out what's the best way to contribute. If you fail, you'll get fired, or the company will fail, so a lot of bad things might happen if you didn't figure it out. You're thrown into this thing; it's almost throwing a kid into a pool so that they learn how to swim, which actually my father did to me, and I ended up being a good swimmer. I ended up being on the national team, swimming for the national team eventually, so we won a lot of competitions and things like that. So, I like that kind of learning.
Human: So that's being a CEO of the startup, does that fit your personality?
Amjad Masad: Yeah, that also, I think another part of my personality is like being interested in a lot of things and having a very well-rounded set of skills. So, I always try to think like, what makes me good or special or whatever and I think nothing in particular, and that's in itself a superpower. Being able to understand business, understand sales, understand product, understand programming on the back-end and front-end, and programming, understand hiring, understand management, all that stuff. I'm interested in all of it. I may not be the best at any one thing, and I'm always able to find people that are better than me at everything that I can do. But, I always like to kind of get in and learn what to do, and then maybe later I'll hire someone that is better at that than me. Right, for me being a CEO ends up being really rewarding and fun because I get to learn on the job a lot of these different things, and then I get to hire people that are better than me to do them instead of me going in and doing them.
