# Replit's community guidelines and rules

Replit's Community is a place where you can share all of the amazing projects you create on Replit! There's a lot to discover and do here, so we'll help you get started.

Some quick links and overview of what follows: -

- [Community Values](#communityvalues)
- [Getting started](#gettingstarted)
- [Community Standards](#communitystandards)
- [Additional Information](#additionalinformation)


# Community Values

**Empower others.**
Replit is for everyone, and everyone starts somewhere. Be patient and inclusive - things that are simple for you may be hard for others. We have absolute beginners and coding experts on our platform, and we want everyone to feel at home here.

**Support one other.**
As part of the Replit Community, we hope you'll share your wins so other members can celebrate you and that you'll return the favor by supporting other users' work through likes, follows, and comments.

**Be kind.**
There is no place for hate in our community. Respect each other, use appropriate language, and be kind. Be positive, and always be sure to reinforce that coding on Replit is a fun and friendly experience.

# Getting Started

**Everyone starts somewhere.** Share your first program - or "repl" - with the community by posting it with the tag `#MyFirstRepl` and introduce yourself by adding a post to your repl with a little bit of information about you. This way, people in the community can come to cheer you on in your coding journey. *Don't share any personal identifying information like your full name or contact info!* 

**Wondering how to share a repl to Community?** Simply open your repl, click on its name in the top right corner and click on the `Publish` button, or, you can go to the [community page](https://replit.com/community/all) and then click on the `Publish a Repl` button there. as shown in the images below.

OR

In either case, you'll then see something like this (might differ slightly):

Here, you can add tags that tell people what you've created, such as `#python`, `#game`, or the name of a hackathon you're participating in, like [#Kajam2021](https://replit.com/community/kajam2021)!. You can also give it an icon to make it even more unique!

To add more information about your repl, you can Add a Post. This is kind of like a caption for your repl.

Note that all your code is automatically updated in the community! So you don't have to post everytime you make a change.

## A quick overview of the community

When you head over to the [Community page](https://replit.com/community), you'll see our Community homepage. *There's always new content on here to explore, but the layout will look the same.*

![Screenshot from 2022-03-26 21-00-19](community_page.png)

**First and most important is the `RESOURCES` section.** These are official posts created by the Replit team that contain helpful information about things like [upcoming events](https://events.thedrone7.repl.co), threads about new features, and the very repl you are reading right now!

**Next up are `TOP TAGS`**. These are the most popular tags on Community. 
* At the top of the list are `official tags` which have a checkmark next to them. These are official tags by Replit that indicate what sort of content you should expect, such as `app` or `game`.
* Below these are popular tags that community members are using on their own repls.

**Now, let's take a look at some posts!** 
You can sort posts as you please: the default `Hot` shows what's trending, `New` sorts the posts in order of the time they were published, and `Top` shows all-time most popular repls and posts.

You can also use the **search bar** to find specific repls and content.

## Community Standards

**Replit is for everyone.** To ensure that everyone feels welcome and safe here, we require all users to agree to our Community Standards.

If you find any repls, posts or comments that violate the standards, you can report it by clicking on the three dots next to the repl's title or comment and selecting "Report".

![report_repl](report_repl.png)

To report a user who has been harassing a lot of people, you can [use this website](https://contact.moderation.repl.co) and we will investigate all of their activity.

### The Terms of Service

All users must follow Replit's [Terms of Service](https://replit.com/site/terms) anytime they use the site. 

Some highlights:

* **No illegal or regulated content.** Please don't use Replit for promoting or engaging in any illegal activity, even unintentionally. This includes dealing in drugs, sex, gambling, weapons, or pirated software.

* **Don't misuse the service.** Do not share content that can harm other users, such as spam, malware, or phishing. We also don't allow repls that consume too many resources, such as spam bots and cryptocurrency miners.

Users who violate these Terms of Service anywhere on the site are subject to be banned from any and all of Replit's services. Banned users may no longer access the online IDE and any code they may have written, the Community, and they will be barred participation in any future events organized by Replit.

### Be Kind

Coders of all levels are creating on Replit! 

Comments are a great place to offer support, ask questions, share ideas, help a new user, geek out about a shared interest, or provide constructive feedback!

Comments are *not* the place to be mean or sarcastic about someone's programming skills or project. If you see anyone bullying or spamming others in the comments, you should report them.

Comments, posts, or repls that go against this standard will be removed from Community and the users will be issued a warning.

### Keep it SFW

Content that makes other community members feel uncomfortable or unwelcome such as swearing, nudity, violent, or graphic content is strictly disallowed.

Any form of content that is found violating this rule will be removed from the community and the creator of such content will either be warned or banned from the community.

### No Hate Speech

There is no place for hate in our community. Respect each other, use appropriate language, and be kind. We do not tolerate targeting any person or group of people for any reason whatsoever. Any abusive or threatening writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially based on race, religion, or sexual orientation goes against our community standards.

We remove any comment, post, or repl containing hate speech from our Community and ban the offending users (after which they can appeal, more details about this at the end).

### No advertising or spamming

We hope all of our users will become dazzlingly wealthy someday, but please don't advertise your wares by sharing links or spamming in comments or posts unless you have specific permission from the author of the post's author.

We remove comments and posts like this and issue a warning to the offending users. After a second warning, the users will be permanently banned from Community.

### Age

Everyone can and should code, but Replit is only available to users above the age of 13. This is due to [COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa) regulations. 

Any users presumed to be under the age of 13 will be temporarily banned from Replit and can appeal by offering proof of their age.

### Some other things to remember

- Give credit and don't plagiarize code. Be sure to give a friendly shout out to the creators whose ideas and code helped you build your project. They'll appreciate it and you'll appreciate it too when your turn for a shout-out rolls around!

- Avoid spamming users by mentioning them in your posts or comments, especially if they have nothing to do with them. 

*Thank you for helping us make our Community a safe and creative place!*

## Warnings and Bans

There are usually 3 kinds of actions that can be taken upon the users breaking the rules.

### Warnings

The user will be warned for breaking minor rules. 5 warnings will lead to a temporary (community) ban.

### Bans

There are 2 kinds of bans - community and site-wide.

The user will be banned from the community only for breaking the rules stated above. However, if they are found breaking the Replit [Terms of Service](https://replit.com/site/terms), then their ban will be site-wide.

When the user is banned from the community, they will not be able to create any posts or comments and they will also be unable to share their repls with the community. However, they will still be allowed to use the online IDE and create new stuff.

When someone is banned site-wide, their account will be terminated, and all of their repls will be taken down and deleted.

Community ban is usually temporary, at the end of which, the user can appeal the ban (more details below). When the temporary ban ends, they will be issued a warning (acting as the first warning towards the second ban).

A second community ban is always going to be permanent.
