# File History

To make sure you never lose any of your work, Replit auto-saves your code as you write. If you ever lose an edit to your code that you'd like to recover, rewind back in time with File History.

## Accessing File History

Open up a code or text file in the Workspace and hit the **History** button in the bottom-right corner.

## Viewing previous versions of a file

Once you've opened up File History, you can view previous versions of a file by using the scroll bar, the arrow buttons, and the **left** and **right** arrow keys.

## Comparing previous versions to the current file

Press the Compare Latest toggle in the bottom left hand of the File History pane to see in-line comparisons of your file at that point in time and the latest version.

## Restoring a previous version of a file

If you want to restore a file to a previous version, just press the `Restore` button, which will restore. Don't worry, you won't erase any history. When you restore to a previous version, it is added as a new version to the file's history.

## Viewing File History playback

You can use the playback feature of File History to watch your file change over time like a movie. This can be useful for creating videos of your programming sessions.
