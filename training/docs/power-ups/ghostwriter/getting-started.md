# Getting Started

Ghostwriter currently includes four features:

**[Complete Code]/ghostwriter/complete-code)** - Ghostwriter's flagship feature. Ghostwriter leverages context to provide code suggestions as you're typing. Press `tab` to accept suggestions.

**[Explain Code]/ghostwriter/explain-code)** - Highlight code, and Ghostwriter will walk through it step-by-step in plain English.

**[Transform Code]/ghostwriter/transform-code)** - Transform Code allows users to highlight blocks of code, describe the adjustments needed (like changing variable names), and Ghostwriter will provide a suggested rewrite of the code block.

**[Generate Code]/ghostwriter/generate-code)** - Provide a natural language prompt, and let Ghostwriter generate code to help solve your problem.

You can get access to these features with a Ghostwriter subscription for 1,000 [cycles]/cycles/about-cycles) ($10 USD) per month.
