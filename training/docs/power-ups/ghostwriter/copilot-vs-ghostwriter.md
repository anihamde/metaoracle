# Comparing Github Copilot and Replit Ghostwriter

In this doc, we'll be comparing Github Copilot and [Replit Ghostwriter](https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter). We'll go over how each works, available features, pricing, and more. Much of the information for Github Copilot in this doc was pulled from Github's Copilot marketing page and their associated docs.

## What is Ghostwriter?

Ghostwriter is more than just an AI pair programmer. It is Replitâ€™s suite of artificial intelligence features which include: Complete Code, Generate Code, Transform Code, and Explain Code. Complete Code is our flagship feature and it offers autocomplete-style suggestions as you code.

## What is Github Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer. It offers autocomplete-style suggestions as you code. You can receive suggestions from GitHub Copilot either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.

## How does Ghostwriter work?

Ghostwriter returns results generated from large language models trained on publicly available code and tuned by Replit. To make suggestions and explain your code, Ghostwriter considers what you type and other context from your Repl like the programming language you're using.

## How does Github Copilot work?

GitHub Copilot analyzes the context in the file you are editing, as well as related files, and offers suggestions from within your text editor. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI.

## What are Ghostwriter's features?

**Complete Code** - Ghostwriter leverages context to provide code suggestions as you're typing. Press `tab` to accept suggestions.
