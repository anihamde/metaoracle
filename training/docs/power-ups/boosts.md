# Boosts

If you want to make your Repls more powerful, you can use the Boost Power Up to increase the number of vCPUs and how much RAM your Repl has.

All Repls come with **0.5 vCPU and 0.5 GB RAM**.

The [Hacker plan](https://replit.com/site/pricing) comes with one **4x Boost (2 vCPUs + 2GB RAM)** you can use on any of your Repls and a **Coding Boost** that applies a **4x Boost (2 vCPU + 2GB RAM)** to the Workspace you are actively coding in.

You can also boost any of your Repls up to **32x (16 vCPUs + 16GB RAM)** with [Cycles](/cycles/about-cycles).

## Boosting your Repl

You can Boost your Repl from inside the Workspace. To activate a Boost:

1. Navigate to your Repl
2. Open the info panel by clicking on your Repl's name in the navbar
3. Open the Boost selection menu by pressing the toggle
