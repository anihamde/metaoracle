## Communication Expectations

To ensure a successful bounty posting and hunting experience, effective communication is crucial throughout the entire process. To assist with this, we have provided several templates that can be used to ensure a professional experience and alignment of expectations. It is important to note that these templates are meant to serve as a starting point, and should be tailored to suit your specific needs and preferences.

## Bounty Hunter

### Upon Acceptance

Once you have accepted a Bounty, you should reach out to the Poster within 24 hours via email or Discord.

```
Hello there,

I'm very excited to begin working on this Bounty. I am located in <geoarea>. I usually work between the hours of <xyzxyz> and the best way to reach me is by email. I just wanted to take a moment to check in and outline my approach.

- <milestone 1> - <your expected date of delivery>
- <milestone 2> - <your expected date of delivery>

Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to working with you.

Best,
Your Name
```

### Check-ins

To ensure a smooth and successful Bounty experience, it is important to maintain regular communication with the Bounty Poster. This includes providing updates on progress every few days, as well as addressing any roadblocks, pain points, or questions that may arise. Lack of visibility into the progress of the project is a common cause of dissatisfaction among Bounty Posters. Keeping them informed will help to mitigate this issue and maintain a positive working relationship.```

#### What to say when giving a status update:

```
I wanted to check-in and give you an update on my progress. Everything is going well and I am still on target to meet <milestone 1> by <expected date of delivery>. Please reach out if you have any questions or further information to share about this Bounty.
```

#### What to say when you need to change the timeline:

```
I wanted to give you an update on my timeline. <xyx> has taken longer than I expected due to <xyxyx> reasons. I have been able to determine next steps, but wanted to let you know my <milestone 1> date has changed to <new expected delivery day>. I have solved any current roadblocks and am on track to complete the Bounty.
```

### Upon Submission

Congratulations on successfully completing the Bounty! It is now important to promptly follow up with the bounty poster to allow them to review the completed work. This will provide an opportunity for them to provide feedback or request any necessary changes. Following up quickly will help ensure a smooth process and timely completion of the project.```

```
Hi there,

I have submitted the completed Bounty at <link to the Bounty>. Please let me know if you requests for changes or have any questions on the submission. It has been a pleasure working with you.
```

### Changes are Requested

If the Bounty Poster requests any changes, it is important to respond within 24 hours to acknowledge receipt of their feedback. During this response, it is crucial to discuss a plan for the next steps and a timeline for implementing the suggested updates. It is important to approach any requested changes in a constructive manner. To assist with this process, we have provided two templates you can personalize:```

Example:

```
Thank you for <list the input or changes requested>. I value your feedback as it helps me become a better Bounty Hunter. I will have a revised version of this project ready for you to review by <date>.

One solution to the input you mentioned is <list the solution in a detailed, non-technical way>. Does this sound like an ideal solution for your Bounty? If so, I can have an updated version to you by <date>.
```

Example:

```
I know you are concerned about <list the concern in a polite way>. Including <list the suggestion in a detailed, non-technical way> may be an ideal solution.

I am open to revisions and willing to make changes to improve the quality of your work. If this solution works for you, I can get you an updated version by <date>.

```

```

### Upon Submission

Once your Bounty Hunter submits the Bounty, we recommend you review the submission within 3 days. If youâ€™re happy with the submission, feel free to press the `Accept` button to complete the Bounty and release the Cycles to the Bounty Hunter. Send them a thank you or acknowledgement that the work has been received and the Cycles released.

```
Hi,

```

### Changes Requested

You can request changes on your Bounty's Discussion tab. It is important that the changes you request are within the scope of the original project. Give clear expectations of what needs to be changed and ensure the Bounty Hunter has the correct resources or access to test projects, if needed.
