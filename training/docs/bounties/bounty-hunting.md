# Bounty Hunting

If you're looking for a way to build projects and earn Cycles while you do it, you're going to love Bounties.

## Become a Bounty Hunter

If you'd like to become a verified Bounty Hunter, [apply here](https://replit.typeform.com/to/ss7IxmIf).
Fill out the form and you'll be notified when you've received the Verified Bounty Hunter badge on your applications.

Otherwise, get started by browsing the [Bounties page](https://replit.com/bounties) and apply to earn Cycles.

## Browse Bounties

Each posted Bounty will include the reward (in Cycles) for successful completion and a description of the work they'd like done.

## Apply to work on a Bounty

Once you find a Bounty you'd like to work on, click the "Apply to Work" button in the upper-right-hand corner.

In your application message, tell the Poster why you're ideally suited to completing the work. Feel free to include links to previous work or your portfolio.

## Do the work

If the Bounty Poster selects your application, you'll see the "Accepted" badge on your application:

  alt="time to do the work!"
/>

Now it's time to do the work!

Communicate with the Bounty Poster early and often - make sure you're both clear on requirements and expectations.

## Deliver the work

When you've completed your work, return to the Bounty page and click "Submit Work."

Add a description of the work (pro-tip: relate it to the acceptance criteria outlined in the Bounty) and link to the Repl where you've written the code.

/>

The Poster will review your work and may ask for changes.
If the changes are in the scope of the original Bounty, simply go back to the Repl, make the changes, and submit again.

Once the Poster accepts your work, you're awarded your Cycles.
