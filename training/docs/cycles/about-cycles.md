# About Cycles

## What are Cycles?

Cycles are Replit's virtual tokens that can be used to purchase extra compute power and functionality for your Repls.

Cycles [can be purchased](https://replit.com/pricing) for $0.01 USD each, starting at a minimum of 150 Cycles. They can be combined with any user plan. You can either make a one-time Cycles purchase or use Auto-Refill to start a monthly recurring Cycles subscription. That means basic plan users can unlock Power Ups as needed (e.g. Private Repls) without committing to a plan. With Cycles, Hacker plan users can surpass the 5 Boosts and Always On that come with their plan.

Create a monthly subscription by toggling Auto-Refill on:

## Managing Your Cycles

Once you purchase Cycles, you can view your balance and usage within your "My Cycles" page located in your menu.

Once your Cycles balance is insufficient, your Power Ups will automatically turn off and you will need to repurchase Cycles to continue accessing the same functionality.

Manage your subscription:

- Click on the pencil, which will lead you to your Stripe page.
- On the Stripe page you will be able to edit your current subscription or cancel it.

## Important Notes

We also want to be clear, Cycles are NOT a cryptocurrency. They are a virtual token native to Replit's platform and do not have any value in real currency.

Purchasing compute resources is just the first step for Cycles. We have a lot more in store for these tokens and what they will become. For now, we're excited to introduce this new Power Up method to our community!
