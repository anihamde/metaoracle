# Introduction to Replit

Replit is a platform for creating and sharing software. You can write your code and host it all in the same place. Replit is also a place to learn how to code, so we have some awesome built-in educational features as well.

Replit can do it all. It can replace your:

- code editor (e.g. VS Code, Sublime Text, IntelliJ IDEA)
- development environment (e.g. your operating system, and build tools like npm or pip)
- cloud provider (e.g. AWS, Netlify)
- team collaboration tools (e.g. Google Docs, GitHub)
- teaching tools (e.g. Canva, Moodle, Blackboard)
- learning tools (e.g. Codecademy, Coursera, Udemy, Udacity)

Every Repl you create is a fully functional development and production environment. "[Hosting from your editor](https://amasad.me/hosting)" makes it easy to iterate quickly on your work, collaborate with others, and get feedback.

We know there's a lot to learn, so we've broken down some of the key features below for [developers](#replit-for-software-developers), [learners](#learning-code-replit-for-students), and [teachers](#replit-for-teachers). Choose your own path, or go through all of them to become an expert in all things Replit!

## Replit for Software Developers

For software developers, Replit can be your IDE in the cloud. Having your IDE live in the cloud has a lot of benefits.

- There's no setup! You can access your environment from any device, including your phone or tablet, and everything will _just work_.
- You can manage things like dependencies, build scripts, and environment variables in a single place and always be in sync.
- It's easy to get help from others. Every Repl is multiplayer-ready by default, so you can work with other developers in a Google Docs-like environment in real-time from anywhere in the world.

And under the hood, a Repl is a Docker container running in a VM, so you can run shell commands and do pretty much anything possible from a standard Linux box.

Check out the learning path below to get started:

### [Introduction to the IDE](/tutorials/introduction-to-the-repl-it-ide)

Learn how to use the Replit IDE through a practical guide

### [Storing secrets](/programming-ide/storing-sensitive-information-environment-variables)

You can easily add environment variables to keep others from viewing sensitive data such as API credentials.

### [Configuring your Repl](/programming-ide/configuring-repl)

Repls are highly configurable and you can customize them to run almost any project in any language in any way you want.

### [Integrating with GitHub](/tutorials/github-and-run-button)

You can link Replit to your GitHub to push changes up or bring in new changes that were made externally.

### [File history](/programming-ide/workspace-features/file-history)

We have a built-in time-travel feature so you can view previous versions of your code.

### [Pair programming](/tutorials/pair-programming-using-multiplayer-with-repl-it)

You can invite your friends or colleagues to help you with problems or hack on stuff together.

### [Web hosting](/hosting/hosting-web-pages)

See how to host a front-end website for your homepage, landing page or portfolio.

### [Deploying HTTP servers](/hosting/deploying-http-servers)

Deploy a full-blown web application written in nearly any back-end language or framework.

### [Always On Repls](/hosting/enabling-always-on)

Keep your Repl alive 24/7.

### [The Replit Database](/hosting/database-faq)

Store data persistently between Replit runs in a simple key-value store that feels like using a local dictionary or hashset.

## Replit for Learners

Whether you're teaching yourself or taking a course, if you're learning how to code, you'll find our learning resources helpful.

You can work through our [project-based tutorials](/tutorials/overview) to learn how to code on Replit. Most of our projects are in Python, the most popular programming language today, and JavaScript, the language of the internet.

If you're learning another language, we probably cover it in one of our teacher-contributed [curriculums](/teaching-curriculum/intro-teaching-curriculum).

We also have a beginner-friendly [forum](https://ask.replit.com/c/code-help/14) and [Discord server](https://replit.com/discord) where you can get (and give) help on nearly anything.

## Replit for Teachers

If you're a teacher or professor who spends significant time teaching coding, whether that be in a classroom or a one-on-one environment, we have features to help you give feedback to students, set up and automatically grade homework assignments, and comply with your local privacy laws.

The following feature docs will help you get started making the most of Replit for teaching:

### [Threads and Feedback](/teams-edu/reviewing-submissions#leaving-feedback-on-projects-using-annotations)

Leave comments on your students' code, or let them peer review each other, using in-line discussion threads.

### [Automatic Testing and Grading](/teams-edu/testing-assessments-autograding)

Imagine if you had a robot to grade your students' homework. You can set up simple or advanced automated tests for your students' assignments and homework.

### [Comply with Local Privacy Regulations](/teams-edu/privacy-faq)

We will help you keep your students and their work safe online, while complying with various privacy laws and regulations such as FERPA, COPPA, GDPR, CCPA, and many others.
