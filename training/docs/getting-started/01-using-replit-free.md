# Using Replit for free

Replit offers a number of helpful features which you don't need to pay for. A free account gives you access to:

- A user-friendly, no-setup online [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://replit.com/site/ide) for beginners with autocomplete and free [automatic hosting](https://replit.com/site/hosting).
- Remote teaching capabilities, allowing teachers to connect with their whole class and help students 1-1 with [multiplayer](https://replit.com/site/multiplayer).
- Support for Python, Java, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and 50+ other [languages](https://replit.com/languages).
- Support for games, graphics, audio and an easy-to-use database.

Read on to learn how to take advantage of our free features. Everything mentioned in this post can be done with a free account.

## Repls

Repls are the core of the Replit service, and they will always be available for all users. You can create as many repls as you like, and in any of the 50+ languages we support. Start by logging into your account, or [signing up for a free account](https://replit.com/signup).

Once logged in, you can create new repls and access your existing ones by navigating to the "My Repls" tab found in the left side-bar menu.

Create a new repl by clicking the blue "+" button in the top-right of your screen. You'll be prompted to choose a language and name your repl. Pick any language you like by typing a name in the search, or by browsing the available languages by category.

Select the owner of the repl, and then click "Create repl". You will notice that repls belonging to free accounts are public.

## Multiplayer

Replit is the first fully multiplayer programming environment, meaning you can invite other people to code and collaborate with you. You can use this function to pair program with others, teach your classroom, create collaborative projects for your students, or simply present your work to others.

For a practical intro to using the multiplayer feature, follow [this tutorial](/tutorials/pair-programming-using-multiplayer-with-repl-it).

## Teams

The Teams feature allows you to share all your repls and folders by default. It isn't necessary for teaching, learning, or collaboration on Replit, but it can make it much easier to work with others.

Teams for Education is now free for all educators. To learn more, check out [Teams for Education](/teams-edu/intro-teams-education).

## Compliance

We take user privacy very seriously and only collect data insofar as it's important to provide our service. You can read more about our privacy policy [here](https://replit.com/site/privacy),) and go through our privacy FAQs [here](/teams-edu/privacy-faq).

As a small, team we're unable to comply with the various ed-tech regulations around the world. However, you can use Replit completely anonymously without providing any identifiable information; just choose a language from our [languages page](https://replit.com/languages) and start coding.

If you're teacher, one anonymous workflow you can use is to create a repl with the instructions and starter code, and then have your students fork the repl, work on the assignment, and send the link back.
